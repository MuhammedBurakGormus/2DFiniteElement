# Rectangular Domain Analysis under Various Mechanical Loadings MATLAB Application

In this repository, there are two folders:
- Simple Version (includes the MATLAB Application and necessary files for the simple version of the project)
- Project Screenshots (includes the screenshots of the detailed MATLAB Application developed for the ME361 Finite Element Course project)

## Simple Version Folder
Under the Simple Version folder, you can find the MATLAB Application developed in order to analyze a rectangular domain under mechanical loadings. \
You need to download all the files and run the "Two_Dim_FEM_Mechanical_Loadings_exported.p" file.

The developed MATLAB GUI consists of 3 parts: PreProcess, Process and PostProcess. 

1. PreProcess: 
- Create a rectangular domain by taking the width and height values
- Decide the mesh density of the domain
- Choose a 2D Element type in order to mesh the domain: (for this version two types of elements, D2TR3N and D2QU4N)
- 




2. Process
- Choose a mechanical loadings type



3. PostProcess
