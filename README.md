# Rectangular Domain Analysis under Various Mechanical Loadings MATLAB Application

In this repository, there are two folders:
- Simple Version (includes the MATLAB Application and necessary files for simple version of the project)
- Project Screenshots (includes the screenshots of the detailed MATLAB Application developed for the ME361 Finite Element Course project)

## Simple Version Folder
Under the Simple Version folder, you can find the MATLAB Application developed in order to analyze a rectangular domain under mechanical loadings. \
The developed MATLAB GUI allows users to:
- Create a rectangular domain by taking the width and height values
- Decide the mesh density of the domain
- Choose a 2D Element type in order to mesh the domain: (for this version two types of elements)
1. D2TR3N 
2. D2QU4N 
- Choose a mechanical loadings type
1. Extension
2. Expansion
3. Shear
